Seine-Sound-Denis is an interactive online experience based on interculturality and the transformations of the soundscapes of Seine-Saint-Denis caused by the future Olympic Games.	 

In the form of a sound map developed with MapboxGL.js, the user can wander around the department and visit a key place in it. Divided into four categories (places of worship, learning and leisure, transport, work, shops and arts and crafts), the user can listen to the landscapes of the SSD today (before the Olympics), in 2024 during the Olympics and then after the Olympics, thus testifying to the traces that an event of such a magnitude can have on a department that is in full development. 	  

With : Antoine Pittilonni, Marie Bardelot, Lauria Alaoua and Artem Arutiunian
